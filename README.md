### Example scenarios

Examples Illustrating Discount Application

* Example 1: Multipurchase Discount Advantage

Customer's Cart: 2 x Service B
Standard Pricing: £12 each
Special Offer for B: 2 for £20
Total without discount: 2 x £12 = £24
With multipurchase discount: £20
Decision: The system applies the multipurchase discount, totaling £20, as it offers better savings.

* Example 2: No Multipurchase Discount

Customer's Cart: 1 x Service F and 1 x Service C
Standard Pricing: Service F at £8 and Service C at £15
No applicable multipurchase discount.
Total without discount: £8 + £15 = £23
Decision: The system calculates the total as £23 due to no available multipurchase discounts.

* Example 3: Mix of Discounts and No Discount

Customer's Cart: 2 x Service F, 1 x Service B
Standard Pricing: F @ £8 each, B @ £12 each
Special Offer for F: 2 for £15
Total without discount: 2 x £8 + 1 x 12 = £28
With multipurchase discount: £27
Decision: The system applies the multipurchase discount for the F products, no discount on B as only 1 bought reducing the total to £27.
